My first full stack app. 
A non-relational mongoose express app with CRUD operations. 

Some Problems I faced: 
1. Model Schema 
    - I did not understand what I was doing building the schemas, I later realized how      the models connect to the web application. 
    - I was later able to understand the Models after I started creating instances and      using the data 
2. Learnings 
    - I was able to learn about requests and responses 
    - The methods to preform CRUD operations and change the state of the website
